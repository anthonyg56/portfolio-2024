Start showering more often, brush your teeth, take care of your hair, eat the
proper ammounts of food daily, excercise in one way or another, keep a control
on mercurian energy in terms of consuming content and infomation. Try not to be
obsessive about things you dont understand just yet and focus on the moment.
